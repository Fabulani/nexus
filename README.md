# Nexus

A gamified framework for tracking projects (quests) and inventory.

Check the `Tutorial` folder for guidance:
- [Usage](./Tutorial/Usage.md)
- [Settings](./Tutorial/Settings.md)
- [Implementation](./Tutorial/Implementation.md)

This repository contains example `.md` files for the framework, as well as plugin settings for the necessary plugins. Plugin versions used can be checked in their manifest file inside `.obsidian/plugins/**/manifest.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> This version is a proof-of-concept.

## Motivation

- inventory: insurance claims will be easier, better, and more accurate with a detailed account of possessions. Specific name, brand, color, receipts, and images are a plus. It also makes it easier to find where things are.
- quests: too many ideas, projects, plans, etc. Can't keep track of them all.

The inventory is not designed for very short-term or consumable items, e.g., a kitchen pantry inventory.
