# Nexus

A gamified framework for tracking projects (quests) and inventory.

## Install

The only pre-requisite is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download).

There are two options:
- For the latest stable release, head over to [Releases](https://github.com/Fabulani/nexus/releases). Download the source code either in `.zip` or `.tar.gz` format.
- For the unstable release, where I'm pushing updates before the next stable release, click on the `< > Code` button and either clone the repo or download the ZIP.

After downloading the files:
1. Extract contents into a folder. 
2. Open Obsidian.
3. Go to `Manage vaults...` > `Open folder as vault` and select the extracted folder.

Select `Trust author and enable plugins` for the full experience, or `Browse vault in Restricted Mode` to check it out without all the plugins. Always be careful when enabling plugins from third-parties!

And that's it! Check the `Tutorial` folder for further guidance:
- [Usage](./Tutorial/Usage.md)
- [Settings](./Tutorial/Settings.md)
- [Implementation](./Tutorial/Implementation.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This version is a proof-of-concept.

## Motivation

- inventory: insurance claims will be easier, better, and more accurate with a detailed account of possessions. Specific name, brand, color, receipts, and images are a plus. It also makes it easier to find where things are.
- quests: too many ideas, projects, plans, etc. Can't keep track of them all.

The inventory is not designed for very short-term or consumable items, e.g., a kitchen pantry inventory.
