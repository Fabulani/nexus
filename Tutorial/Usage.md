# How to use this system

- Use the command `QuickAdd: New <template name>` and pick one of the templates. Adjust properties in the created file.
## Creating new templates

One of these:
- Click on the `New Template` button in the ribbon.
- Use the command `QuickAdd: New Template`.
## Creating new classes

Metadata Menu, QuickAdd, and Templater are used for the class system:
1. Create a note for each selector field with all possible values in `Settings/Fields`
2. Create a file class in `Settings/Classes`. This represents a new type of class and defines the fields for the template.
3. Use the command `QuickAdd: New Template` (or click on the button in the ribbon) to create a new template file. Wait until it prompts for adding properties, and click on the "add to end of front matter" button on the top right of the modal.
4. Create a new QuickAdd template choice for creating the note.

## Updating a note's front matter

Easiest method is to click on the class icon button in the note and select "Insert missing fields in the front matter". It's at the bottom of the front matter.

Another method is to use the command `Metadata Menu: Bulk insert missing fields` and click on the last button, "Insert at the end of the front matter".
